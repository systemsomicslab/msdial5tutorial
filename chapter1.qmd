## 1. GC-MS (nominal mass)

The environment for GC-MS data analysis in MS-DIAL5 is now under construction. Please use version 4 series for which the tutorial is available here: <https://mtbinfo-team.github.io/mtbinfo.github.io/MS-DIAL/tutorial.html#chapter-4>

## 2. GC-MS (high resolution)

## 2. LC/MS or LC/MS/MS (data dependent MS/MS) project with user-defined MS/MS database (MSP format)

Here, a project involving data-dependent MS/MS acquisition in conjunction with a user-defined MSP library (a composite library comprising MassBank, GNPS, and Respect) is presented.

### Input Data

This section utilizes a total of 6 ABF files, with the MSP file being located in the same ZIP folder as this demonstration.
The ABF files for this demonstration can be downloaded from http://prime.psc.riken.jp/compms/msdial/download/demo/20160805-Wine-DDA-Pos-Demo%20files.zip .
The experimental protocol has been previously described in the following research: http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jafc.5b04890.

#### Experiment summary:
- **Liquid chromatography:** total 4 min run per sample with Kinetex C18 2.6 μm (50×1.0 mm).
- **Solvent A:** water with 0.1% acetic acid
- **Solvent B:** acetonitrile with 0.1% acetic acid
- **Mass spectrometer:** data dependent method with positive ion mode.
  - Collision energy, 35 V
  - Collision energy spread, 15 V
  - Cycle time, 125 ms
  - Mass range, m/z 60-1250

### The video tutorial for the MS-DIAL operation

### Key points in the MS-DIAL operation

1. All sample `Type`s are `Sample`. The input data here does not contain `QC` or `Blank`.
2. For this input data, set a different `Class ID` for each sample.
3. You can paste Excel cells to MS-DIAL sample table.

## 3. CE-MS/MS

## 4. All ion fragmentation with multiple collision energies

## 5. MS-DIAL isotope tracking function
