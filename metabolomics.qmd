(3)In the peak detection section, you can change the parameters for peak detection. The data used in this tutorial are nominal mass data, so Accurate MS is **not** checked.  

![fig2-4](images/gcnominal/2-4.png)

(4)Configure identification setting.Please choose whether to use retention index or retention time for annotation. If you use retention index, click Set and designate the PATH of the retention index to be used.If there are library you want to reference, click Browse and designate the library.　　

### 1-4 Result of annotation
![fig3](images/gcnominal/fig3.png)     

This is the main viewer of MS-DIAL. (1) Double-clicking on a file name in the file navigator will display the detected peak information in the center window(Peak spot viewer).Blue spots indicate peaks of lower abundance in the sample, red spots indicate peaks of high abundance, and green spots indicate peaks of intermediate abundance. (2) Click on the triangle at the top of the Peak spot viewer to display the compound corresponding to the retention time.(3) The MS1 spectrum of the focused peak is displayed in the left window of the Peak spot viewer. (4)The ion chromatogram of the focused peak is displayed in the upper window.(5)Other peak information is displayed in the upper right window.

(9)The Spectrum deconvolution section allows you to set parameters for deconvolution of the spectrum.   
(10)Please choose whether to use **retention index** or **retention time** for annotation. If you use retention index, you need to set up index file.This tutorial uses retention time.   
(11)Finally, set the alignment parameters and click Run.　　

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}   
If you use a retention index,make sure you have the right retention
index for the data you want to analyze.

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/cZY7wqF5Wdo >}}

### Key points in the MS-DIAL operation

1.  All sample `Type`s are `Sample`. The input data here does not contain `QC` or `Blank`.
2.  For this input data, set a different `Class ID` for each sample.
3.  You can paste Excel cells to MS-DIAL sample table.

## 3. CE-MS/MS
A project dealing with CE-MS/MS data measured using vDIA(variable data independent acquisition) in combination
with migration time correction is demonstrated.

This tutorial uses 19 demonstration data files and three libralies which are downloadable from
the below link.\

[https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10597056/dims.zip](http://prime.psc.riken.jp/compms/msdial/download/demo/dims.zip)

#### **Experiment summary:**\
-   Hydrophilic metabolites were extracted from RAW264.7 cells according to previously described protocol.
  (Human metabolome Technologies Inc. Patent JP WO2014045932 A1)
-   Capillary electrophoresis was performed using a CE System 7100(Agilent Technologies Inc.), 
  and an Agilent 1260 isocratic HPLC pump was used to create the sheath flow.
-   The MS/MS spectrum was acquired using Q Exactive Plus (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.)  with vDIA

#### **Note:**\
-   **Txt format library**
   -   In this tutorial, two txt files, "Identification_anion.txt" and "MTcorrection_anion.txt",
      were used for identification of internal standards and migration time correction, respectively.
   -   See below link for the details of library format: <http://prime.psc.riken.jp/compms/msdial/main.html#Templates>
-   **Migration time (MT) correction**
   -    Migration times of metabolite ion peaks were linearly corrected along the MT axis using internal standard compounds.
   -   If migration times of the reference compounds in each file doesn't match reference MT,
      change the parametors from reference compound informatin table and try MT correction again.
