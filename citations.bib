	abstract = {We report a computational approach (implemented in MS-DIAL 3.0; http://prime.psc.riken.jp/) for metabolite structure characterization using fully 13C-labeled and non-labeled plants and LCâ€“MS/MS. Our approach facilitates carbon number determination and metabolite classification for unknown molecules. Applying our method to 31 tissues from 12 plant species, we assigned 1,092 structures and 344 formulae to 3,604 carbon-determined metabolite ions, 69 of which were found to represent structures currently not listed in metabolome databases.},
