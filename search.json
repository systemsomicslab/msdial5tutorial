Profile data provides a detailed representation of each peak’s shape and width, capturing continuous intensity values across a range of m/z values. This detailed information is essential for resolving closely spaced or overlapping peaks, particularly when analyzing complex samples with isomers or other closely related compounds. In contrast, centroid data simplifies each peak to a single point at its central m/z value, reducing noise and processing time but potentially losing important details about peak shapes. This can lead to challenges in distinguishing between overlapping peaks or accurately quantifying compounds. Therefore, choosing the correct data format ensures that the analysis is optimized for the complexity of the sample, allowing for more precise identification and quantification of compounds."

MRMPROBS was originally developed for targeted metabolomics using triple quadrupole MS data (multiple reaction monitoring, MRM; selected reaction monitoring, SRM). It also supports the entire workflow from data import until statistical analysis as MS-DIAL does. Compared to the MS-DIAL program, MRMPROBS is optimized for targeted metabolomics:\n\nusers can manually curate the peak left- and right edges of chromatographic peaks\nusers can simultaneously check all samples’ peaks of a targeted compound, and 3) users can easily curate the identification results.\n\nWhile the current MS-DIAL program always calculates the peak intensity (height) and peak area of compounds by the survey scan MS1 data, MRMPROBS can utilize the MS/MS chromatograms for metabolite quantifications. In addition, the tools for untargeted analysis like MS-DIAL will often provide the false positive things in the process of peak picking, deconvolution, and peak alignment. In contrast, users can easily parse the targeted compounds with the user-friendly graphical user interface. The ‘bridge’ from MS-DIAL to MRMPROBS is described in the video below. The workflow can also be utilized for GC/MS data.

    "text": "Step-by-Step workflow for duplicating alignment spot features to separate isomers in the GUI\nThis tutorial demonstrates how to separate isomeric compounds in lipidomics and metabolomics projects by duplicating alignment spot features. The process is designed to be efficient, with minimal time requirements. Start by opening MS-DIAL 5.3. Next, select and open your processed lipidomics or metabolomics project to load it into the software. Once your project is loaded, you will see the alignment result window displaying your data (eg., lipidomics data) within MS-DIAL.\nNext, click on “Show Ion Table” to view the lipids annotated by MS-DIAL. Further, proceed with the peak picking process. If you identify isomeric compounds within your data, follow the subsequent steps to separate those isomeric mixtures effectively (Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Start up a project in MS-DIAL 5.3. by selecting your processed lipidomics or metabolomics project (A). Once the project is loaded, click on the “Show Ion Table” to view the list of lipids annotated by MS-DIAL (B). Proceed with peak picking and the identification of isomeric compounds in the data (C). Examine the aligned spots and isomeric peaks by checking in the EIC of aligned spot (D).\n\n\n\nSelect the lipid that appears as isomers in the ion table. Next, navigate to the EIC (Extracted Ion Chromatogram) of the aligned spot to view the peaks, and use the alignment spot viewer to examine the isomeric compounds. To duplicate the isomeric peaks, right-click and drag to zoom in on the alignment spot of the isomeric compounds within the alignment spot viewer. Then, right-click on the aligned spot and select “Duplicate Selected Peak Spot.” Finally, return to the ion table, where the duplicated peak of the isomeric compound, will appear at the bottom.\nSelect the duplicated isomeric peak and recheck the peaks in the EIC of the aligned spot. Minimize the ion table, then right-click on the EIC of the aligned spot and select “Peak Curation (EICs Overlay)” to begin separating the isomers. The “Aligned Chromatogram Modification” window will appear, displaying the original EIC, aligned chromatograms, and manually modified chromatograms. Right-click on the aligned chromatograms and drag to select the low-intensity peak of the duplicated isomer, and click “Update.” After updating, close the “Aligned Chromatogram Modification” window, reopen the ion table, and refresh the list. The separated isomeric peak of the duplicated isomer can now be seen in the EIC of the aligned spot. For better clarity, consider renaming the duplicate peak to facilitate understanding (Figure 2 and 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: After selecting the isomeric peak, click on the “Duplicate Selected Peak Spot” option to create a duplicate for the isomer (A). Verify the duplicated isomeric peak will appear at the bottom of the ion table (B). Select the peak curation (EIC overlays) to adjust the intensity of the peak (C). Finally, adjust the peak intensity for the duplicated isomeric peak in the aligned chromatogram (D)\n\n\n\nNext, open the ion table and select the original isomeric peak. Follow a similar process to separate this peak by rechecking the peaks in the EIC of the aligned spot. Right-click on the EIC of the aligned spot and choose the “Peak Curation (EICs Overlay)” option to begin the separation process. In the “Aligned Chromatogram Modification” window, right-click and drag to select the high-intensity peak of the original isomeric peak from the aligned chromatograms, then click “Update” to apply the changes. After updating, refresh the ion table to see the separated peak intensity of the original isomeric peak, distinct from the duplicated isomer (Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Refresh the ion table and rename the duplicated isomeric peak for better understanding (A). Next, select the original isomeric peak and cross-verify the peaks in the EIC of aligned spot (B). Click on peak curation (EIC overlays) to adjust the intensity of the original peak (C). Finally, select the peak intensity for the original isomeric peak in the aligned chromatogram and click “Update” to confirm the changes (D)\n\n\n\nTo get a clearer view, right-click and drag to zoom in on the alignment spot of the separated isomeric peak within the Alignment Spot Viewer. Finally, save your project and export the results (Figure 4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Refresh the ion table and cross-verify the separation of the isomeric peaks by selecting the original isomeric peak (A) and alignment spot (B)\n\n\n\nThe video for using this feature can be found below"

In addition, technological advances in fragmentation mechanisms such as electron-impact excitation of ions from organics (EIEIO) have also been taken into account, making it possible to work with these types of data to offer comprehensive structural identification of metabolites, lipids, and proteins. These resources enhance the identification and quantification of metabolites and lipids. After data processing which includes peak picking, deconvolution, compound identification, and peak alignment, MS-DIAL provides several normalization methods (including LOWESS) and a multivariate analysis by principal component analysis (PCA). Finally, for further analysis by other programs, this program can export your result as table format (for SIMCA-P, MetaboAnalyst, and MetFamily etc.), and as several spectral formats including NIST, MassBank, and Mascot formats for compound identifications by MS-FINDER, CSI:FingerID, CFM-ID, MetFrag, and MetFamily etc."

    "text": "4.0 Step-by-step guide on how to set up a project in MS-DIAL 5\nThis tutorial demonstrates how to start a new project in MS-DIAL 5, covering the steps to import raw data and set the MS method type. To begin, launch MS-DIAL 5 from your desktop or application menu, which will open the main user interface with various options and toolbars. The first step is to create a new project by setting up a dedicated folder where all project files, including raw data and results, will be stored. After selecting New Project from the “File” menu, choose the designated folder to ensure data is organized. Next, you can import raw data directly into MS-DIAL 5 without the need for conversion to ABF format. After selecting your raw data files, proceed to configure the MS method type according to your experiment, ensuring the appropriate settings are in place for accurate data analysis. This streamlined process sets the foundation for efficient data processing in MS-DIAL 5 (Figure 2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Start up a project in MS-DIAL5. First, select a new project to be created (A). Next, click browse to select a location where your project files will be saved (B). Select the folder where you want to save the MS-Dial project (C). Click run to go to the next parameter setting (D)\n\n\n\nAfter selecting the project folder, click on Browse in the raw measurement file section, and navigate to the folder where your raw data is stored. Select the raw files you wish to analyze, or simply drag and drop your files (including .d format files) directly into MS-DIAL 5. Once you’ve selected the appropriate files, click Open to import them. After importing your raw data, you can further assign identifiers to your measurements based on sample type (e.g., Sample, Standard, QC, Blank). You can also categorize them by class ID, according to your experimental design. At this point, you need to set the acquisition type for each raw data file.\nHere’s how to set the MS method type:\nDDA (Data-Dependent Acquisition): Select this if you are analyzing single MS or data-dependent MS/MS data.\nDIA (Data-Independent Acquisition): Choose this option when analyzing SWATH or AIF data, where MS/MS data is acquired independently of precursor ions.\nFor a detailed walkthrough on selecting the acquisition type, refer to the video linked below, which demonstrates the process visually.\n\nAfter selecting the acquisition type, you can further customize your project by setting additional parameters. If your analysis involves multiple batches, you can assign batch numbers to differentiate between them and account for batch effects during data processing. You can also specify the analytical order of your samples, which is useful for tracking trends such as signal drift or other variations that may have occurred throughout the run. Additionally, you can set a dilution factor for each sample, allowing MS-DIAL to adjust the quantification accordingly. If certain samples are not needed for further analysis, you can choose to exclude them from the data processing (Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Click on the browse icon and point MS-DIAL5 to the folder where your raw data is stored (A). Next, select the raw file format as per your analysis (B). Select the raw files for analysis (C). Further, assign identifiers to your measurements and acquisition type (D)\n\n\n\nAfter assigning identifiers to the raw measurement files, click Next to proceed to the Measurement Parameters tab. In this section, you will input the analytical and instrumental parameters that were used during data acquisition. These settings are crucial for ensuring accurate data processing and should align exactly with the experimental conditions under which the measurements were taken (Figure 4).\nThe following sections will offer detailed instructions on how to select and configure each parameter within the Measurement Parameters section\n4.1 Measurement Parameters Section:\n1. Ionization type: Select the soft ionization type, when you are analyzing the ESI data or select hard ionization type when you are analyzing the EI data.\n2. Separation type: Select chromatography (for LC, GC, CE, or SFC) or direct infusion method as per your analysis. Additionally, you can check ion mobility box coupled with one of the previous options.\n3. Collision type: Select the corresponding collision type according to your analysis.\n4. Data type (MS1): Select the profile or centroid data as per your analysis in MS1.\n5. Data type (MS/MS): Select the profile or centroid data as per your analysis in MS/MS.\n*Refer to the tutorial on MS-Dial on how to determine profile or centroid data type for your analysis using the Rawdataviewer tool in the below link.\nhttps://systemsomicslab.github.io/msdial5tutorial/Determining%20MS%20data%20types.html\n6. Ion mode: Select the corresponding ion mode according to your analytical setup.\n7. Target Omics: Select what kind of omics data you want to perform. If you select the ‘lipidomics’ project, you do not have to prepare NIST MSP format library since MS-DIAL internally contains the theoretical MS/MS spectra of lipids (and actually, the fragment ions are future evaluated by the decision tree algorithm to provide the proper lipid structure representation). On the other hand, when you select the ‘metabolomics’ project, your own MSP file will be required for compound identification.\n8. Advanced option: You can provide additional information regarding your experiment. This metadata will be included in the MassBank, MoNA and NIST (MSP) format export.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Overview of the Measurement parameter settings\n\n\n\nAfter configuring each parameter in the Measurement Parameters section, click “Next” to proceed to the Data Collection tab. In this section, you will need to enter the data collection parameters that were used during the acquisition of your samples. These parameters are essential for accurately processing and analyzing your data according to the conditions of your experiment (Figure 5).\nThe upcoming sections will provide detailed instructions on how to set each parameter in the Data Collection section.\n4.2 Data collection parameters:\nMass accuracy (Centroid parameter): After the initial peak detection in MS-DIAL, mass tolerance defines the acceptable range of mass deviation for both MS1 and MS/MS data. By default, mass tolerance values are set to ±0.01 Da for MS1 and ±0.025 Da for MS/MS. This means that peaks within these ranges around the detected mass are integrated and considered for further analysis. Importantly, the MS/MS tolerance also influences how MS/MS chromatograms are constructed, affecting how closely the detected fragment ions need to match the theoretical masses to be included in the MS2Dec deconvolution process.\nData collection parameters: In MS-DIAL, you can define the analysis ranges as per your analysis for retention time (RT), MS1, and MS/MS axis to focus on specific parts of your data. For this demonstration, we have chosen the expected data range as follows: In this demo data RT range is 0 - 100 min, and the MS and MS/MS range is 0 – 2000 Da.\nExecute Retention Time Correction: This setting adjusts for any shifts or drifts in retention times that may occur during the analysis, ensuring that peaks are aligned accurately across different samples or runs. Use this function when you analyze your data on different elution conditions (eg., different columns).\nIsotope Recognition: Isotope recognition is used to identify and handle isotopic peaks that correspond to the same molecular ion but with different masses due to natural isotopic variations (e.g., [M+1] or [M+2]). This process helps in accurately quantifying the main molecular ion by distinguishing it from its isotopic counterparts. As long as you focus on small molecule research (less than 2000 Da), the maximum charged number can be set to 2. On the other hand, the parameter can be changed to 8 or more to process proteome or snRNA research data.\nConsider Cl and Br Elements: If you assume your samples might contain chlorine (Cl) or bromine (Br), enable this option as these elements have unique patterns in their isotopic distribution. This setting helps to accurately identify and quantify compounds by recognizing the specific isotopic peaks that Cl and Br create.\nMultithreading: Please set the count of threads that you want to use. You can check the maximum thread counts in resource monitor. (open task manager-&gt;open resource monitor).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Overview of the Data collection parameter setting.\n\n\n\nClick Next to proceed to the Peak Detection Parameter Settings. In this section, you’ll need to enter the parameters used for peak detection in your mass spectrometry data. This includes specifying values such as the minimum peak height, mass peak width, and exclusion mass list (Figure 6).\nThe following sections will offer detailed guidance on how to configure each parameter within the Peak Detection section\n4.3 Peak detection parameter:\nMinimum Peak Height: Set the minimum intensity level required for a peak to be detected in your data. Peaks with heights below this threshold will be ignored, which helps in filtering out noise and focusing only on significant signals for accurate analysis. Ideally, users put values here based on their own experience that you are looking at the trend of your data. However, based on our experience, the minimum peak height may be set to 1000 as a default value for this demo data. Besides, for FT-MS or Orbitrap data, the minimum peak height maybe 10,000 or more.\nRefer to the tutorial on how to determine the minimum peak height for your analysis using the Rawdataviewer tool in the link below.\nhttps://systemsomicslab.github.io/msdial5tutorial/Determine%20the%20optimal%20minimum%20peak%20height.html\nMass Slice Width: Define the range of mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) around each detected peak that will be considered during data analysis. This width helps in grouping ions within a specified m/z range to improve peak detection and quantification by accounting for slight variations in mass measurements. In this case, we are using 0.1 Da. From our experience, 0.1 and 0.05 are suitable for Q-TOF and Orbitrap, respectively.\nSmoothing method:Linear-weighted moving average is used for the peak detection as default to accurately determine the peak left- and right edges.\nSmoothing level: The recommended smoothing level is 1-3. It is the number of points on each side of the peaks.\nMinimum peak width: Minimum peak width indicates a threshold of peak width for filtering. For example., we choose a minimum peak width set to 5 scans, peaks that span less than 5 scans will be excluded from the results. Only peaks with a width of 5 scans or greater will be included in the analysis.\nExclusion mass list: If you already know unwanted m/z peaks because of columns or solvent contaminants, you can specify them to exclude those peaks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Overview of the Peak detection parameter settings.\n\n\n\nClick Next to proceed to the Spectrum Deconvolution Parameter Settings. In this section, you will configure the parameters for deconvoluting your mass spectrometry data. Key settings include the sigma window value, the MS/MS abundance cut-off value, and the option to exclude peaks following the precursor ion (Figure 7).\nThe following sections will provide detailed instructions on how to set each parameter within the Spectrum Deconvolution section.\n4.4 Spectrum deconvolution parameter:\nSigma window value: The sigma window value is highly affected by the resolution of deconvolutions. A higher value (0.7-1.0) will reduce the peak top resolutions, i.e. the number of resolved peaks will be decreased. On the other hand, a lower value (0.1-0.3) may also recognize many noise chromatographic peaks. In our demo data, we have chosen 0.5.\nMS/MS Abundance Cut-off: MS/MS Abundance Cut-off refers to the minimum intensity level of the MS/MS (tandem mass spectrometry) signals that must be reached for a fragment ion to be considered significant and included in the analysis. Unless you have data-independent MS/MS data sets, you can skip this part. However, you may set a cutoff value to reduce the MS peak noise levels.\nExclude after precursor ion: If you want to remove the product ions after the focused precursor ion (recommended for metabolomics and lipidomics), check this box.\nKeep the isotopic ions until: In fact, the isotopic patterns in MS1 spectra are frequently disturbed. On the other hand, there are some cases that the isotopic patterns in MS/MS spectra are clearer than that of MS1 spectra, which can be used for the accurate annotation of molecular formula. If you set this parameter as 5 Da, the ions until precursor + 5 Da are kept after MS2Dec algorithm is finished.\nKeep the isotopic ions w/o MS2Dec: The MS2Dec algorithm may sometimes erase the precursor’s isotopic ions due to the mathematics issues. Therefore, you can keep the raw MS/MS spectra only for the precursor’s isotopic ions by checking this option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Overview of the Spectrum deconvolution parameter settings.\n\n\n\nClick Next to proceed to the Identification Parameter Settings. In this section, you will configure parameters related to the identification of compounds, including the database type, lipid profiling settings, annotation options, and retention time settings (Figure 8).\nThe following sections will provide detailed instructions on how to set each parameter within the Identification section.\n4.5 Identification parameter:\nMSP file: In the case that you selected the ‘lipidomics’ project, select what you want to annotate in your data sets for lipid profiling. For example, we selected all the lipids to analyze in our data. For this tutorial data, in which ammonium acetate was used as a solvent type, select HCOONH4 (ammonium formate) as the solvent type in the window ’Lipid database setting, although nowadays CH3COONH4 (ammonium acetate) is basically used as a solvent type.\nIf you are selected as a metabolomics project, insert the MSP file. Several MSP files are downloadable as a starter kit for MS-DIAL using below link\nhttps://systemsomicslab.github.io/compms/msdial/main.html\nMS-DIAL supports the MSP file format in ASCII text. In addition, the software can utilize “RETENTIONTIME:”, “PRECURSORTYPE:”, and “FORMULA:” information for metabolite identification (cases are ignored). Retention time information must be specified in minutes [min] scale when possible. The adduct ion information, i.e. here ‘Precursor type’, will be used for the adduct ion search algorithm. You can also insert your own MSP file by clicking “+” icon in the database setting. Select that MSP file and click on the upper arrow in the annotation method setting to give a first preference.\nText format library: MS-DIAL also supports a tab-delimited text format library for peak identification using retention time and MS1 accurate mass information. The identification process is performed after completing peak identification based on the MSP format library. This is why we call this identification processing “post-identification”. The first row should include header information. The first, second, third, and fourth columns should contain the metabolite name, accurate mass [Da], retention time [min], and adduct ion, respectively. This library can be easily created in Microsoft Excel. Save the spreadsheet in “Tab-delimited text format”. This option is useful for internal standard identifications etc. (Even if you don’t have MS/MS libraries, the peak identification based on retention time and accurate mass is available from this option). * The minimum requirement for this text library is just ‘metabolite name’ and ‘m/z’ information; i.e. the first two columns are required. Retention time and adduct ion fields provide additional information for MS-DIAL in peak identification and adduct ion picking, respectively.\nRefer to the tutorial video on MS-DIAL for guidance on how to import a text library file using the link below.\n\nAnnotation method: If you put RT information in your MSP file, set the RT tolerance value. For example, the predicted RT information is optimized for the 15-min LC method. If you set the RT time tolerance to 1.5 min for your data. It will compare the RT of the same lipid/metabolite in different sample. If the difference is high means it will not consider that peak in all the samples. If suitable RT information is unavailable, set the tolerance to 100 (default) or larger (larger than your LC time). The two mass tolerances for MS1 and MS2 are required for the compound search and are dependent on your instrument performance.\nMS2 spectrum cut-off: The minimum intensity value for ions to be considered during analysis. Any fragment ions with intensities below this threshold are excluded from the spectrum, helping to reduce background noise and improve the quality of data interpretation. The mass spectrum peak less than the user-defined value will not be used for the MS/MS similarity calculation. Also, enter the mass range at the beginning and end. If you don’t have information no need to enter. Use the default values.\nAnnotation cut-off: In MS-DIAL, these parameters are crucial for determining how closely your experimental spectra match reference spectra from databases during the identification process. They help score the similarity of fragmentation patterns compared to the record in the database. If the MS/MS has5 peaks for 1 compound, if you give for example., 60%, then 3 peaks should match with a reference database. It is also the same for the minimum number of matched spectra. If you don’t have information no need to give any values. Use the default values.\n4.5.1 Retention time setting:\nRetention time scoring and filtering: If you set the tolerance and you selected the filtering means, it will not take peaks which the difference in RT between the samples more than you entered in RT tolerance. Unless you check neither Use retention time for scoring nor Use retention time for filtering, the value of RT tolerance does not mean anything. If you didn’t select the RT filtering means the total score will be calculated and compared with the observed peak (RT score) of a lipid/metabolite in your data and the score of the peak (RT score) from a reference library.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Overview of the Identification parameter settings. Selecting lipids for the analysis (A). Setting identification parameters (B).\n\n\n\nClick on Next to proceed to the Adduct Ion Parameter Settings. In this section, you will need to select the adduct ions relevant to your analysis.\nThe following sections will provide detailed instructions on how to choose and configure adduct ions for your analysis (Figure 9).\n4.6 Adduct ion parameters:\nAdduct ion setting: You can tick the adduct ions and charge values which is suitable for your analysis.\nAdduct ion format: Adduct ion information should be formatted as described in this section: [M+Na]+, [M+2H]2+, [M-2H2O+H]+, [2M+FA-H]-, etc.\nThe parentheses ‘[’ and ‘]’ must be used to bracket the ion information. The char + and - are required after ‘]’ and the number must be written before + or -.\nWhen you want to define the organic formula like C6H12O5, you have to write it without any replicate elements or parentheses like [M+C2H5COOH-H] or [M+H+(CH3)3SiOH].\nThe beginning figure of organic formula like ’2’H2O is recognized as the H2O × 2. Again, do not use 2(H2O) to specify this.\nSequential equations are acceptable: [2M+H-C6H12O5+Na]2+.\nMS-DIAL accepts some abbreviations or common organic formulas for adduct types as follows.\nFor Acetonitrile: ACN, CH3CN\nFor Methanol: CH3OH\nFor Isopropanol: IsoProp, C3H7OH\nFor Dimethyl sulfoxide: DMSO\nFor Formic acid: FA, HCOOH\nFor Acetic acid: Hac, CH3COOH\nFor Trifluoroacetic acid: TFA, CFCOOH\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Overview of the Adduct parameter settings.\n\n\n\nClick Next to proceed to the Alignment Parameter Settings. In this section, you’ll need to configure various parameters including the reference file, RT tolerance, RT factor, features based on blank information, and peak count filter for adduct ions (Figure 10).\nThe following sections will provide detailed instructions on how to set each of these parameters for optimal alignment of your data.\n4.7 Alignment parameters:\nResult name: The name will be the name of each alignment shown at the tab of ‘Alignment navigator’ in the main window.\nReference file: If you already have suitable quality control (QC) data, typically mixed sample data, then specify the QC file in the reference file. All sample data will be aligned to this QC file.\nRT and MS1 tolerances: The RT and MS1 of the peak will be compared with the library RT and MS spectra. Typically, give the default setting values.\nRetention time factor and MS1 factor: These values indicate the importance of either RT or MS1 to compare and evaluate the similarity of the spectra among samples based on RT and MS1 tolerance.\nEquation to calculate the RT factor: =exp(-0.5*(sample1(RT)-sample2(RT))/RT tolerance)^2)\nEquation to calculate the m/z factor: =exp(-0.5*(sample1(m/z)-sample2(m/z))/m/z tolerance)^2)\nPeak count filter: If you want to remove specific peaks that are not fully detected in the alignment, specify the peak count filter.\nFor example, if you have 3 biological replicates with the same peak information and the total number of data is 24. Then, you may set the peak count filter as (3/24)∗100. This means peaks will be removed when they include missing values for more than the entered peak count filter (%). In the tutorial data we have only 3 samples.\nN% detected in at least one group: The filtering is done within each sample group. If it is set to 100%, the peaks should be detected in all of the samples of a class.\nRemove Features Based on Blank Information: If you include blank sample information in your analysis and want to incorporate it into the results, enable this option. This allows MS-DIAL to evaluate and filter peaks based on the blank sample data. Once this option is checked, you can also adjust the following settings:\nKeep ‘Reference Matched’ Metabolite Features: This option ensures that any metabolites matched to a reference library (such as MSP or Text libraries) are retained, even if they appear in the blank sample.\nKeep ‘Suggested (without MS2)’ Metabolite Features: This retains metabolites that are annotated based on their MS1 feature alone, without MS2 data, even if they exceed the blank feature threshold.\nKeep Removable Features and Assign the Tag: By selecting this, any features that don’t pass the blank feature threshold will still be included in the results, but they will be marked as removable. You can review these features by using the “Blank Filter” checkbox in the Peak Spot Navigator pane. If you uncheck this option, the blank-related features will be fully removed from the analysis, and you will no longer be able to view them after alignment. In our data, we are using the default option set by tool.\nGap Filling by Compulsion: This enables to recognition of peaks based on the average peak width of detected metabolites across samples, even if a local maximum isn’t observed in the chromatogram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Overview of the alignment parameter settings.\n\n\n\nClick Next to proceed to the Isotope Tracking Settings. In this section, you will configure the settings to enable isotope tracking in your data (Figure 11).\nThe following sections will provide detailed instructions on how to set up the isotope tracking parameters for your analysis.\n4.8 Isotope tracking parameter:\nTracking of isotope labels: If you check this box, it will identify and monitor the isotopically labeled lipids or metabolites in your sample. This is especially useful in lipidomics or metabolomics experiments where stable isotopes like 13C or 2H are incorporated into lipids or metabolites in your study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Overview of the Isotope tracking parameter settings.\n\n\n\nThen you can click Run for the processing of your MS data in MS-Dial 5 and click Save to save the project.\nOnce you finished the data processing like peak picking, peak identification, and peak annotation. You can click the export icon to export the results in different forms (Figure 12).\nThe following sections will provide detailed instructions on how to export your results.\n4.9 Export:\nHere, in this case, we are using the alignment results export option to get all the spectral information of lipids.\nThe following options are used to export the results:\nPeak list export: You can get the peak list information of each sample including retention time, m/z, MS/MS spectra information, and so on. Available formats are MSP, MGF, or Text.\nAlignment result export: You can get the results of your data especially spectral information of lipids or metabolites. To export alignment results you just need to choose an export folder path and choose an alignment file that you want to export. Select export format if you want to export the representative spectra. Then click the export button.\nMolecular spectrum networking export: You can obtain results that show the relationships between molecular features based on their fragmentation patterns.\nCopy screenshot to clipboard (emf): By copying a screenshot to the clipboard in EMF format, you get a vector-based image that retains high quality when resized.\nParameter export (Tab-delimited text): By exporting parameters as a tab-delimited text file, you get a structured file containing the settings and parameters used during your analysis. This format makes it easy to review, share, or import the parameters into other tools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Overview of the export parameter settings"

It indicates how consistently the feature is present across multiple injections or samples (Figure 13A).\nFill% helps assess the reliability of detection for a particular compound in a sample, indicating how frequently it was detected during analysis.\n2: Meaning of S/N average:\nS/N (Signal-to-Noise) Average refers to the average ratio of the signal’s intensity (the compound of interest) to the background noise over multiple scans. A higher S/N ratio indicates a clearer signal against background noise (Figure 13B).\nA higher S/N ratio means that the signal is clearly distinguishable from the noise, indicating reliable detection of the compound.\nLow S/N ratios might indicate that the compound is difficult to detect due to high background noise, which could make identification and quantification less reliable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Fill % (A) and S/N average (B) ratio across mass spectrometry data"

    "text": "How to determine optimal minimum peak height?\nIn the RawDataViewer tool, click on browse and select any raw file to determine the optimal minimum peak height, and click open. Once the file is loaded into the software, go to the method type section and choose the appropriate method based on your analysis. Select the Ion Mode (positive or negative) to match your sample. After configuring these settings, click Load to upload the file. Once the file is loaded, select the file and click the show button to display the data. Once you click the show button, a new window will appear displaying a histogram of peak height, MS, and MS/MS peak intensity information. This window also provides a table with details such as scan start time, polarity, MS levels, base peak m/z, and base peak intensity for each metabolite in your sample (Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Open the RawDataViewer application (A). Browse and select the raw MS file to determine whether the data is centroid or profile (B). Click the load button to load the raw file into the tool (C). Click the show button to display the histograms of peak information\n\n\n\nNext, check the number of peaks in the histogram of peak height. This histogram displays the number of peaks within specified height ranges, with each column bar representing the count of peaks at different heights. Then click on the index column in the table to check the number of peaks present in the raw data. Typically, in metabolomics/lipidomics studies, a reasonable number of peaks falls between 3000 ~ 5000 peaks. The histogram graph illustrates how peaks are distributed across different peak height cut-offs, helping you identify the transition from noise to meaningful peaks. Peaks on the left side of the graph, often highlighted in red, generally represent noise associated with a lower peak threshold. In contrast, peaks on the right side, highlighted in purple, are more reliable and correspond to a higher threshold. It depends on what kind of instrument you are using and how many peaks users want to analyze in their data. If they select a lower peak height threshold it will include more peaks but may also capture more noise peaks, while a higher peak height threshold will reduce noise peaks and highlight more relevant peaks. A number of peaks in each peak height cut-off point can be seen. By carefully selecting the optimal minimum peak height threshold based on the histogram analysis, you can achieve a balance between retaining significant data and reducing noise, thereby improving the quality of your analysis (Figure 2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Select the index to see the number of peaks in table (A).

In this latest version, the user experience has been greatly improved with a new graphical interface and also due to the fact it is no longer necessary to convert raw MS data from different vendor formats into a common ABF format (which is still supported), but the data can now be imported directly (supported file formats and analytical techniques are summarized in Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Overview of supported file formats and analytical techniques\n\n\n\nThe latest version of MS-DIAL aims to be the most versatile tool for multiomics data analysis and therefore supports direct injection, many separation (GC, LC, CE, SFC), ionization (EI, ESI, MALDI), fragmentation (CID, HCD, ETD, ECD, EIEIO, EID, OAD) and MS/MS (DDA, SWATH, AIF) datasets (which are summarized in Figure 2). In addition, technological advances in fragmentation mechanisms such as electron-impact excitation of ions from organics (EIEIO) have also been taken into account, making it possible to work with these types of data to offer comprehensive structural identification of metabolites, lipids and proteins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Summary of analytical techniques compatible with MS-DIAL 5\n\n\n\nAfter data processing which includes peak picking, deconvolution, compound identification, and peak alignment, MS-DIAL provides several normalization methods (including LOWESS) and a multivariate analysis by principal component analysis (PCA). Finally, for further analysis by other programs, this program can export your result as table format (for SIMCA-P, MetaboAnalyst, and MetFamily etc.), and as several spectral formats including NIST, MassBank, and Mascot formats for compound identifications by MS-FINDER, CSI:FingerID, CFM-ID, MetFrag, and MetFamily etc. For the parameter explanations including the description of MS-DIAL algorithms, see also ‘MS-DIAL mathematics’ which can be downloaded at http://prime.psc.riken.jp/Metabolomics_Software/MS-DIAL/MS-DIAL%20FAQ-vs2.pdf"

    "text": "Start up a project of MS-DIAL5\nThis tutorial demonstrates four projects, (1) GC/MS, (2) LC/MS or LC/MS/MS (DDA: data dependent acquisition), (3) LC/MS/MS (data independent acquisition), and (4) LC-Ion mobility for the explanation of parameters and required files. In this section, three projects are summarized and you will find a minimum requirement for these processes. The details for LC/MS/MS (DIA), LC/MS/MS (DDA), GC/MS, and LC-Ion mobility processing are described in Chapter 2, Chapter 3, Chapter 4, and Chapter 10 respectively. First you need to start a new project in MS-DIAL5, set up a folder to store your project files and point MS-DIAL5 to the folder where your raw data is stored (Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Start up a project in MS-DIAL5. First select new project to be created (1), next select a location where your project files will be saved (2). You need to direct MS-DIAL5 to your raw data file location (3) and select the corresponding data file format in the scrolling selection list and select the data files you want to process (4).\n\n\n\nAfter inserting your raw data files, you will be able to further assign identifiers to your measurements by sample type (Sample, Standard, QC, Blank), class ID (according to your experimental setup), and you can also set the batch (if you analyzed multiple batches), analytical order, dilution factor, or possibly exclude some samples from further data processing (Figure 4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Specifications of raw measurement files. An example of assigning identifiers to your raw measurement files (more details will be described in the following sections).\n\n\n\nAfter assigning identifiers to the raw measurement files, click “Next” to go to the “Measurement parameters” tab. Here you will need to enter the analytical and instrumental parameters that were used to acquire your data (Figure 5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Measurement parameters. Overview of the parameters that need to be set according to your analytical and instrumental setup.\n\n\n\nThe following sections will contain information about the data type (centroid and profile), the data format of custom user database (MSP file), and information about the types of adducts. The next chapters will then demonstrate case studies of processing different types of publicly available data in MS-DIAL5.\n\nCentroid or Profile?\nIn the previous version of MS-DIAL users needed to define the type of imported data (centroid or profile). However in the new version you can choose centroid data by default. MS-DIAL retrieves data as centroid even for vendor formats which were previously considered as profile (e.g. SCIEX or Thermo). The only exception would be regarding Agilent data which can be stored as centroid, profile or both. To make sure what type of data you have, we recommend using our program “raw_data_viewer.exe” (which is available in the MS-DIAL base folder). The raw data viewer shows the spectrum that has been retrieved by the MS-DIAL backend (here you can determine the data type), and users can additionally determine the threshold values for amplitude cut off etc. by looking at the statistics of peak height vs. the frequency (Figure 6 and Figure 7).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Raw data viewer - data upload. After opening the “Raw data viewer.exe” you can browse to the location of your data (1) and load them (single or multiple files - one by one) (2). Next select the file you want to process (3) and click the “Show” button (4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Raw data viewer - results. After processing the data you will be shown three histograms (for MS1 and MS2 spectrum intensity and peak height). Additionally you can browse to any ions found in your data (in the table provided at the bottom). You can order the ions by multiple parameters (scan start time, MS level, base peak m/z, base peak intensity, etc.). You can zoom the x (m/z) and y (Intensity) axis by using scroll button to inspect if your data are centroid or profile. Using this overview you can also estimate the ideal peak height cut-off for the MS-DIAL processing parameters.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you can also watch our tutorial video:\n\n\n\nDatabase (MSP or Text) for compound identification\nThe database formats for GC/MS or LC/MS datasets are described in this section. The main difference between GC/MS (EI-MS) and LC/MS (ESI-MS/MS) is the availability of precursor ion and its MS/MS. While a precursor m/z and its MS/MS are mostly available in ESI (or the other soft ionization)-MS/MS, the molecular ion in EI-MS is difficult to detect owning to the hard ionization. Several MSP files are downloadable as a starter kit for MS-DIAL at http://prime.psc.riken.jp/Metabolomics_Software/MS-DIAL/index.html.\n\nMSP format for precursor- and MS/MS library\nMS-DIAL supports the MSP (http://www.nist.gov/srd/upload/NIST1a11Ver2-0Man.pdf) format in ASCII text (Figure 8). In addition, the software can utilize “RETENTIONTIME:”, “PRECURSORTYPE:”, and “FORMULA:” information for metabolite identification (cases are ignored). Retention time information must be specified in minutes [min] scale when possible. The adduct ion information, i.e. here ‘Precursor type’, will be used for the adduct ion search algorithm (see section 7).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: An example of MSP format library\n\n\n\n\n\nAdduct ion format\nAdduct ion information should be formatted as described in this section: [M+Na]+, [M+2H]2+, [M-2H2O+H]+, [2M+FA-H]-, etc.\n\nThe parentheses ‘[’ and ‘]’ must be used to bracket the ion information.\nThe char + and - are required after ‘]’ and the number must be written before + or -.\nWhen you want to define the organic formula like C6H12O5, you have to write it without any replicate elements or parentheses like [M+C2H5COOH-H] or [M+H+(CH3)3SiOH].\nThe beginning figure of organic formula like ’2’H2O is recognized as the H2O × 2. Again, do not use 2(H2O) to specify this.\nSequential equations are acceptable: [2M+H-C6H12O5+Na]2+ (very apt.)\nMS-DIAL accepts some abbreviations or common organic formulas for adduct types as follows.\n  For Acetonitrile: ACN, CH3CN\n  For Methanol: CH3OH\n  For Isopropanol: IsoProp, C3H7OH\n  For Dimethyl sulfoxide: DMSO\n  For Formic acid: FA, HCOOH\n  For Acetic acid: Hac, CH3COOH\n  For Trifluoroacetic acid: TFA, CFCOOH\n\n\n\nText format library for retention time and accurate mass search (post identification)\nMS-DIAL also supports tab-delimited text format library for peak identification by means of retention time and MS1 accurate mass information. The identification process is performed after completing peak identification based on MSP format library. This is why we call this identification processing “post identification”. The first row should include header information. The first, second, third, and fourth columns should contain the metabolite name, accurate mass [Da], retention time [min], and adduct ion, respectively (Figure 9). This library can be easily created in Microsoft Excel. Save the spreadsheet in “Tab delimited text format”. This option is useful for internal standard identifications etc. (Even if you don’t have MS/MS libraries, the peak identification based on retention time and accurate mass is available from this option.)\n* The minimum requirement for this text library is just ‘metabolite name’ and ‘m/z’ information; i.e. the first two columns are required. Retention time and adduct ion fields provide additional information for MS-DIAL in peak identification and adduct ion picking, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: An example of a text library\n\n\n\n\n\nMSP format as GC/MS library\nMS-DIAL supports the MSP format (http://www.nist.gov/srd/upload/NIST1a11Ver2-0Man.pdf) in ASCII text, same as in the “MSP format for precursor- and MS/MS library” seciton. MS-DIAL accepts two fields for ‘retention’ information as the reference: “RETENTIONTIME:” or “RT”, and “RETENTIONINDEX” or “RI” (Figure 10). Retention time information must be specified in minute [min] scale when possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: An example of MSP format library for GC/MS\n\n\n\n\n\nAlkane- or FAME retention time dictionary for the calculation of retention index\nRetention time and retention index are used for routine identification of metabolites in GC/MS based metabolomics. The current MS-DIAL program has three options for the use of retention information: 1) retention time, 2) alkane mix based retention index, and 3) FAME (fatty acid methyl ester) mix based retention index.\nSee the experimental details of alkane and FAME mixtures.\nAlkanes: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389172311001848\nAlkanes: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kovats_retention_index\nFAMEs: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2805091/\nIn order to calculate the retention indexes of detected peaks, users have to prepare a dictionary including the pairs of the carbon number and its retention time as tab-delimited text (Figure 11).\nFAQ\n\nBy alkane mixture, the calculation of retention index is based on Kovats’s method (temperature programmed chromatography).\nBy FAME mixture, the calculation is based on Fiehn’s method. Importantly, FAMEs of carbon number C8, C9, C10, C12, C14, C16, C18, C20, C22, C24, C26, C28, and C30 (total 13 FAMEs) must be included in this dictionary to calculate Fiehn’s index. A polynomial regression of fifth order is applied to chromatographic peaks between C9 and C28. The peaks between C8 (and its earlier) and C9 and between C28 and C30 (and its later) are interpolated by a linear regression. The original indexes are based on the retention time (sec) * 1000 of authentic standards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Examples of FAMEs and Alkanes dictionaries"
